### CPU fan for UDOO VISION heatsink

You don’t need a CPU fan for your ordinary activities, but the fan will help you out with complex projects that require a lot of power.  
The CPU fan is applied on the bottom part of the board. It has 3 pins and you can set up thresholds inside the BIOS to automate it. It’s pretty much plug-and-play.

The fan is provided with the UDOO VISION itself for those that bought the board from Kickstarter, but it will come soon in the [official shop](https://shop.udoo.org/)!
