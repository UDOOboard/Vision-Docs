UDOO Vision is a Single Board Computer built upon a Pico-ITX pocket-size form factor, based on the *Intel&reg; Atom&reg; Apollo lake* family of System-on-Chips (SoCs), a series of Quad Core SoCs with **64-bit instruction set** and very low TDP.

Thanks to the x86_64 instruction set, the **UDOO Vision** supports the *Windows* distribution for **32-bit**(aka i386, IA-32, x86-32, x86_32) and **64-bit**(aka x64, x86-64, x86_64).

We suggest to always use a **64-bit** Windows version.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> Please notice that total amount of 8GB of RAM of the UDOO Vision X7 version would be usable only with 64-bit OS. Total amount of memory available with a 32-bit OS depends on the OS itself (less than 4GB, however).

The supported version of Windows are:
* Microsoft&reg; Windows 10 (64-bit)
* Microsoft&reg; Windows 10 Enterprise (64-bit)
* Microsoft&reg; Windows 10 IoT Core (32- /64-bit)

In the [Getting Started](**TODO: insert correct link**) section you can find a guide of how to install Windows, the example is based on Windows® 10 64-bit.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> If you have issues with the TRRS microphone in Windows® 10 try to install the *Realtek High Definition Audio Codecs* audio drivers from [this page](https://www.realtek.cz/download-ALC283-sound-driver-for-Windows10-64bit.html)

In order to download the latest updated versions of the Intel&reg; devices drivers (e.g. Graphics HD drivers, chipset, wireless networking) we suggest to download and run the [Intel® Driver & Support Assistant](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24345/Intel-Driver-Support-Assistant) for Windows&reg;.
