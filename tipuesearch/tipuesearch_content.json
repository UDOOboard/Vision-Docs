On UDOO VISION you can run all the software available for the PC world, from gaming to video streaming, from graphical editors to professional development platforms, plus all the software for the Arduino\u2122 Leonardo world, including all the sketches, libraries and the official Arduino\u2122 Leonardo IDE. Thanks to the embedded Intel\u00ae HD Graphics 500 GPU, you can use all the OpenVINO\u2122 toolkit to build projects which leverage the power of AI. UDOO VISION embeds two processors: a Quad Core 64-bit Apollo Lake family 14nm processor, designed for the PC domain (The Intel\u00ae Atom\u2122 E39XX System-on-Chips (SoCs) comes with 1.6 GHz base frequency and with 64-bit instruction set and very low TDP. This single chip solution includes the memory controller, which gives support for up 32-bit Quad-Channel LPDDR4 2400 MT\/s Memory.) the Microchip ATmega32U4 8-bit AVR microcontroller, the same of Arduino\u00ae Leonardo. While the Apollo Lake processor can run all the Windows and Linux 64bit distros you want to use as desktop PC, the ATmega32U4 allows easy access to an Arduino\u2122 Leonardo environment. Download the User Manual to have a more complete explanation of the UDOO VISION hardware. Soon will be published video tutorials on the UDOO website, to start using your new UDOO VISION board. If you have any trouble uploading the Arduino sketch running Linux, check the Linux Known issue - Sketch upload section in the Getting Started with Arduino Leonardo page. Heads up! In order to prevent damages to your board, remember to: Never provide more than 5V in input to the GPIOs of the Arduino Leonardo-compatible(Atmel\u00ae ATmega32U4). Never keep the board in touch with metal objects or surfaces while it is powered up. Power the board with a stabilized power supply (DC-jack with a standard 5.5mm\/2.1mm barrel jack, internal positive, Voltage 12V \u00b1 5%, at least 3A). Do not use a NON-standard USB 3.0 peripheral. If you use a non-standard USB 3.0 peripheral with an external power plug, this could send current back to the UDOO VISION board with the risk of damage. Lineup UDOO VISION retail line up consists of two models, UDOO VISION X5 and UDOO VISION X7. Check the Board Versions section to see the differences between the two UDOO VISIONs.

The eMMC use a SD 3.0 compliant interface. Heads up! As a flash-based storage device, excessive drive access, particularly write commands, reduces its life. Therefore, it is strongly suggested to NOT create a swap partition on the eMMC device. SATA Both Apollo Lake E3940 and E3950 processors embed a SATA Controller, which offers up to two SATA III 6.0 Gbps interfaces. Of these interfaces, one SATA channel is carried out to a standard male SATA connector, CN11 (the other SATA channel is available on the M.2 Key B socket). A dedicated power connector (CN10), can be used to power 2.5&quot; Hard Disk Drives (or Solid State Drives) connected to the SATA male connector. The dedicated power connector is a 4-pin male connector. You can find this cable in the SATA data and power cables for UDOO VISION kit. Heads up! To connect a 3.5&quot; Hard Drive you need to provide SATA +5V+12V combo power supply from an external source. \u03bcSD The SoCs used on UDOO VISION module offer a SD\/MMC 4.0 compliant interface, that can be used as a boot device and\/or to add another mass storages media other than the internal eMMC and the two SATA interfaces. This SD interface is carried to a standard \u03bcSD card slot (CN13), soldered on bottom side of the module, push-push type.

Thanks to the x86_64 instruction set, the UDOO VISION supports all the x86 Linux distribution for 32-bit(aka i386, IA-32, x86-32, x86_32) and 64-bit(aka x64, x86-64, x86_64). We suggest to always use a 64-bit OS version. Heads up! Please notice that total amount of 8GB of RAM of the UDOO VISION X7 version would be usable with 64-bit OS. Total amount of memory available with a 32-bit OS depends on the OS itself (usually less than 4GB unless the OS isn't using PAE). Famous Linux distributions Here you can find an unordered list of 10 of the most popular Linux distributions: Ubuntu: is probably the most well-known Linux distribution. Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it has its own software repositories. Much of the software in these repositories is synced from Debian\u2019s repositories. Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish is the latest Ubuntu released version, even if it is not officially supported by OpenVINO\u2122 Toolkit. To use such framework, download Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa. Linux Mint is a Linux distribution built on top of Ubuntu. It uses Ubuntu\u2019s software repositories, so the same packages are available on both. Originally, Mint was an alternative distribution loved mainly because it included media codecs and proprietary software that Ubuntu didn\u2019t include by default. Debian is an operating system composed only of free, open-source software. The Debian project has been operating since 1993 \u2014 over 20 years ago! This widely respected project is still releasing new versions of Debian, but it\u2019s known for moving much more slowly than distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. This can make it more stable and conservative, which is ideal for some systems. Arch Linux is more old school than many of the other Linux distributions here. It\u2019s designed to be flexible, lightweight, minimal, and to \u201cKeep it Simple.\u201d Keeping it simple doesn\u2019t mean Arch provides tons of graphical utilities and automatic configuration scripts to help you set up your system. Instead, it means Arch dispenses with that stuff and gets out of your way. Fedora is a project with a strong focus on free software \u2014 you won\u2019t find an easy way to install proprietary graphics drivers here, although third-party repositories are available. Fedora is bleeding edge and contains the latest versions of software. CentOS \/ Red Hat Enterprise Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a commercial Linux distribution intended for servers and workstations. It\u2019s based on the open-source Fedora project, but is designed to be a stable platform with long-term support. openSUSE \/ SUSE Linux Enterprise openSUSE is a community-created Linux distribution sponsored by Novell. Novell purchased SuSE Linux in 2003, and they still create an enterprise Linux project known as SUSE Linux Enterprise. Where Red Hat has the Fedora project that feeds into Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Novell has the openSUSE project that feeds into SUSE Linux Enterprise. Mageia \/ Mandriva Mageia is a fork of Mandriva Linux created in 2011. Mandriva \u2014 known as Mandrake before that \u2014 was once one of the great user-friendly Linux distributions. Slackware Linux is another institution. Founded in 1993, Slackware is the oldest Linux distribution that\u2019s still maintained and putting out new releases today. Puppy Linux is another fairly well-known Linux distribution. Previous versions have been built on Ubuntu, but the latest is built on Slackware. Puppy is designed to be a small, lightweight operating system that can run well on very old computers. Others useful distributions: LibreELEC \u2013 Just enough OS for KODI Kodi is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation. LibreELEC (short for Libre Embedded Linux Entertainment Center) is a distro based on Kodi, is a non-profit fork of OpenELEC as an open source just enough OS (JeOS) Linux software appliance distro for Kodi. Lakka is a lightweight Linux distribution that transforms a computer into a full blown game console for retrogaming.

The IP address is a number that uniquely identifies a device in a network. It will be useful to know which IP your UDOO VISION is assigned to for connecting to it remotely. There are various way to find the private IP Address, so let\u2019s get started. First method: Command Line If your UDOO VISION is connected to a screen, you can simply find the IP Address of the board using the tool exploited by the OS you are using. Linux Windows On a Linux distribution open a terminal and type: ip a This command will output informations related to both Ethernet and Wi-Fi status, including respective IP addresses, besides the loopback address. udooer@udoovision:~$ ip a 1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link\/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1\/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1\/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: enp2s0: &lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default qlen 1000 link\/ether 00:c0:08:9d:8f:87 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 3: eno1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000 link\/ether 00:c0:08:9d:8f:88 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff altname enp3s0 inet 192.168.1.217\/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eno1 valid_lft 85535sec preferred_lft 85535sec inet6 fe80::1e12:98b8:f21:ca6d\/64 scope link noprefixroute valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 4: wlp1s0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000 link\/ether 3c:58:c2:fa:6c:b6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 192.168.0.104\/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp1s0 valid_lft 7192sec preferred_lft 7192sec inet6 fe80::571d:74a6:d6c7:ed4b\/64 scope link noprefixroute valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever In this example the Ethernet IP address is 192.168.1.217 and the Wi-Fi IP address is 192.168.0.104. Alternatively, with older Linux distro, you can also use the command ifconfig. A quick way to find your IP address in Windows is by running the ipconfig command in a Command Prompt window. You\u2019ll see your IP address in the IPv4 Address row beneath the name of your connection. Using Windows 10 you can right-click the Start button. In the Menu appeared click on Command Prompt an invoke the ipconfig command. --&gt; Second method: use the Fing - Network Tools Mobile App Fing is a network scanner app, which will help you to discover every device connected into your network. Simply go to the Android or Ios market, download and launch it. If UDOO VISION is properly connected to the same network your phone is (whether via Wi-Fi or ethernet), you should see it and discover its IP address. Link to the stores: Android Google Play and IOS App Store You'll find UDOO VISION connected through the GB Ethernet identified as Seco. If the board is connected to the Network through Intel Wi-Fi\/BT module you'll find it identified as Intel Third method: use your Router control panel Just connect to your router control panel: open your browser and type the IP address of your router. Usually this is 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.254. Once you\u2019re prompted with a user and password login box, log in (if you\u2019ve not changed them, there are good chances they would be: admin as both user and password). Navigate to the devices list, which can be called also status or manteinance, you should see your UDOO VISION with his IP address. Here you are. Now that you know your IP address, you can easily access your UDOO VISION.","tags":"","url":"Basic_Setup\/Find_IP_Address.html"},{"title":"Remote Terminal (SSH)","text":"You can use UDOO VISION as a Desktop PC, connected to 4K or UHD monitors, keyboard and mouse. This is probably the most used setup, but if you want you can communicate with the board in remote way, so long as you leaving the board connected to a network. Requirements A first condition to establish a SSH connection with your UDOO VISION is to have previously completed the tutorial about Find IP Address. A second condition is to install a SSH Server on your UDOO VISION system, and install an SSH Client on the PC from which you want to connect to UDOO VISION. SSH Server on UDOO VISION Choose the software for the OS you've installed on your UDOO VISION. Linux Windows On a Linux system we suggest to use OpenSSH Server. On Ubuntu\/Debian\/Linux Mint type the following command: $ sudo apt install openssh-server N.B: On Ubuntu you usually find the openssh-server already installed out of the box. On RHEL\/Centos\/Fedora type the following command: # yum -y install openssh-server On ArchLinux type the following command: # pacman -S openssh You can change some OpenSSH server configuration in the file \/etc\/ssh\/sshd_config. Make a copy of the original sshd configuration file first. sudo cp \/etc\/ssh\/sshd_config \/etc\/ssh\/sshd_config.backup sudo gedit \/etc\/ssh\/sshd_config Heads up! Take note of your Linux username and password. These will be required during the connection from the client. If you want to use another SSH Server different from OpenSSh, you can find a comparison of SSH Server here. On Windows you usually won't use the SSH connection to access a terminal, so we suggest to follow the docs on the next page to use a complete Remote Desktop (VNC) connection. SSH Client on the remote PC On the PC from which you want to connect to UDOO VISION choose the client for the OS you use. Linux Windows On a Linux system we suggest to use OpenSSH Client. On Ubuntu\/Debian\/Linux Mint type the following command: $ sudo apt install openssh-client N.B: On Ubuntu you usually find the openssh-server already installed out of the box. On RHEL\/Centos\/Fedora type the following command: # yum -y install openssh-clients On ArchLinux type the following command: # pacman -S openssh There are lots of valid SSH clients for Windows. We suggest to use MobaXterm, a complete enhanced terminal for Windows with X11 server, tabbed SSH client, network tools and much more. Another famous SSH client is PuTTY. Connection via SSH Once you have completed these steps, open your SSH client. For the sake of this example, we consider you're using PuTTY on Windows. Opening PuTTY a window will ask you to specify the destination you want to connect to. In the first blank space, named Host Name or IP address, type the IP Address of UDOO VISION. Eventually, a Windows Firewall popup could appear the first time you do this. If this happens, allow PuTTY to bypass the firewall. When the connection succeeds, a black window will appear. That is the terminal. It will ask you to enter your login credential. Type the name of the user , then press &quot;Enter&quot;. A new line will appear: &lt;username&gt;@&lt;IPAddress&gt;' password: Type the password of the username then press &quot;Enter&quot;. Heads up! Do not worry if you don't see what you type in the terminal: it's an expedient to hide your password to eventual onlookers. At this point you can use your terminal: Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (GNU\/Linux 5.15.0-46-generic x86_64) * Documentation: https:\/\/help.ubuntu.com * Management: https:\/\/landscape.canonical.com * Support: https:\/\/ubuntu.com\/advantage 90 packages can be updated. 40 updates are security updates.

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. Basically VNC allows you to use your keyboard and mouse of your PC to interact with the graphical desktop environment of the UDOO VISION from remote. Requirements A first condition to establish a VNC connection with your UDOO VISION is to have previously completed the tutorial about Find IP Address. A second condition is to install a VNC Server on your UDOO VISION system, and install an VNC Client on the PC from which you want to connect to UDOO VISION. VNC Server (on UDOO VISION) A VNC server is a program that shares a desktop with other computers over the Internet. Choose the software for the OS you've installed on your UDOO VISION. Linux Windows On Linux you usually need to install a VNC Server. There are various alternatives. For example you can install one of these through the package manager of your Linux Distro or downloading from the official websites: x11vnc tightvncserver tigervnc realvnc Some distros comes with a functional preinstalled VNC Server, so you can check if the distro are you using already has a desktop sharing software. For example Vino is the default VNC server in Ubuntu to share your existing UDOO VISION desktop. Follow the instruction in the link to enable the desktop sharing feature. At this page you can find a list of the most common VNC Servers used in Ubuntu: Ubuntu VNC\/Servers. If you come across an encryption Vino error trying connecting follow this page. Vnc Vino Ubuntu Security fix Windows 10 comes with a Remote Desktop Server already installed. The PC must be running Windows 10 Pro\/Education\/Enterprise. If you Windows 10 version is the Home you can not access it remotely. You need to turn on the Remote Desktop feature on the UDOO VISION in this way: Right-Click the Start button and go to System In the Left Menu click on Remote settings Check the Allow remote connections to this computer radio button. For a higher level of security, check the Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication(recommended) Click Apply and OK Now the Remote Desktop service is enabled an ready to accept remote connections. You can find other infos here. VNC Client on the remote PC Now you need to install a VNC Client on the PC from which you want to connect to UDOO VISION. Linux Windows There also are lots of valid VNC clients for Linux. For example, VNC Viewer, VNC\u00ae Viewer for Google Chrome\u2122, TightVNC, TigerVNC. Choose the one you prefer and install it in the remote PC. Windows 10 comes with a VNC Client already installed. In the search box of the Windows taskbar, type Remote Desktop Connection to find it. In the Computer box you can use the IP Address or the Computer Name assigned to your UDOO VISION. We suggest to use IP Address. There also are lots of valid VNC clients for Windows. For example, MobaXterm, a complete enhanced terminal for Windows with X11 server, tabbed vnc client, network tools and much more. Other alternatives could be VNC Viewer, VNC\u00ae Viewer for Google Chrome\u2122, TightVNC, TigerVNC. Connection via VNC Regardless of the system and software you are using all the VNC client will ask you to insert the IP Address of the UDOO VISION to connect with it. After the connection is established you will need to insert the credential, username and the password, of the user configured in the UDOO VISION Operating System.","tags":"","url":"Basic_Setup\/Remote_Desktop_(VNC).html"},{"title":"Understanding Linux Software Management And Installing","text":"Overview In this tutorial we'll take Ubuntu as example. Ubuntu, a linux based operating system, handles software management in a way you may not be used to. It is however, very convenient at the end of the day. Ubuntu features a repository system, which is a software collection stored on several servers, which you can access and install with few commands. This ensures that updating and installing software is easy, efficient and safe. To quote from Wikipedia: In software, a package management system, also called package manager, is a collection of software tools to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner. It typically maintains a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. Packages are distributions of software, applications and data. Packages also contain metadata, such as the software's name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database. Ubuntu integrated software manager is a command-line tool called apt. Using it is very straight forwarding. Apt has it\u2019s own repository list, stored in \/etc\/apt\/sources.list You can add or remove software sources by editing this file. To see its content just type: cat \/etc\/apt\/sources.list It is however suggested to edit this only if you know what you are doing. Before attempting to install a software from a repository, let\u2019s update the apt cache. This is basically a database of all available software, that includes dependencies and version informations. To update: sudo apt update Then, let\u2019s assume we want to install nano, a very useful and simple text-editor: sudo apt install nano We will be asked if we wish to continue, let\u2019s reply yes. So, type y Apt will then download, unpack and install all file needed for us. Just wait a while and it will finish. Let\u2019s assume then, we want to remove a program, for example vim (another text-editor) sudo apt remove vim Again, we reply yes typing y. Some other useful commands for apt, and system housekeeping, are: apt autoremove removes automatically packages that are no longer required apt clean deleted downloaded packages that are wasting disk space We can now use another package manager, with a graphical user interface, Synaptic, which is the default package manager in most Ubuntu versions. We\u2019ll use apt to install synaptic apt install synaptic Once installed, we\u2019ll find Synaptic Package Manager in the \u201cOther\u201d applications menu. Let\u2019s open it. Type your root password, and enter. You can then, search and install every package you like, in a nice and user friendly environment. To start, we will enable more software sources than we have by default. To do this, go to settings then repositories and check all the repositories you wish to enable; typically you should be good enabling all software sources from the \u201cUbuntu Software\u201d tab. Once done, close and hit reload, which is the same as apt update. When finished, you can start searching and browsing for thousands of different softwares, to install them simply tick the checkbox, select Mark for installation and hit apply. You have now at your disposal all the software you need to further expand UDOO VISION capabilities.","tags":"","url":"Cookbook_Linux\/Understanding_Linux_Software_Management_And_Installing.html"},{"title":"Linux Command Line Interface","text":"Overview Linux Command Line Interface, (CLI from now on) could be at first glance discouraging for the average Joe, since nowadays we are only used to Graphic Interfaces. But don\u2019t let you down, using a command line shell could be, not only very useful, but also kind of funny. This Tutorial will help you move your first steps in the command shell environment. First, when a Command Line Interface could be useful for you? Remote Connection via SSH: SSH remote connection allows to interact with UDOO VISION without physical access to it. SSH is available only with command line interface. Using a minimal Linux Distribution without a graphical interface. Some Linux Distribution come without a Graphical User Interface, in order to maximize available resources. Command line interface is your only bet in this scenario Some power-users consider CLI the most convenient way to perform code execution and file-system operations. Even if you are not in this category, you may found out that CLI can be very fast when you get used to it. Showing up with your mates, the longest your CLI strings, the more rep you\u2019ll get. So, let\u2019s start this adventure with the very basic Linux commands: sudo Your first ally, allows users to run programs with the security privileges of root, or superuser.Its name is a concatenation of &quot;su&quot; (substitute user) and &quot;do&quot;, or take action . So, if you get an error message saying that \u201conly root can do that\u201d, just use the same command with preceeded by sudo. sudo In fewer words: sudo su This just enables root privileges once for all, without forcing you to type sudo everytime. It works until you close the shell you are working into. sudo su touch create an empty file touch nano open an handy text editor, to save and exit, press &quot;ctrl&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, and tell yes or no by pressing &quot;y&quot; or &quot;n&quot; nano cat cat shows the content of a file, it speeds up file inspection for smaller files. cat \/etc\/hostname ls Shows you the content of a folder ls cd opens a specific folder cd \/home cd ubuntu cd .. Brings you to a higher folder level cd \/home\/ubuntu cd .. # this goes to the \/home\/&lt;user&gt; folder cd \/ brings you to root (top filesystem level) cd \/ rm deletes a file rm myfile.my rm -rf deletes a folder rm -rf \/home\/ubuntu\/myfolder rm -rf myfolder mv moves a file or a folder. Useful for renaming also mv myfile \/myfolder\/myfile mv myfile mysecondfile cp copies a file cp myfile \/home\/ubuntu\/ cp -R copies a folder cp -R myfolder \/home\/ubuntu\/myfolder mkdir creates a folder mkdir myfolder top Top is a very useful utility, it basically gives you a complete overview of the system\u2019s status. It produces an ordered list of running processes selected by user-specified criteria. Top shows how much processing power and memory are being used, as well as other information about the running processes. top df -h Shows used and available disk space, in megabytes. df -h ifconfig -a Shows networking useful data, like current ip, netmasks and other statistics. ifconfig -a chmod chmod let you set files permissions. This utility is very important for people concerned about security, but it is useful also for coders, since you can set a script as executable with it . For a more comprehensive guide on how to use chmod see here dmesg Shows the messages resulting from the most recent system boot. It is useful for troubleshooting, since you can see which modules are loaded, which binaries are started and so on. dmesg sync Thanks to this command your SD card lifespan will drastically improve, remember to launch it every time you turn UDOO DUAL\/QUAD off, or remove the power. Completes all pending input\/output operations. It must be launched as root, or with sudo. sync reboot reboots the system reboot shutdown shuts it down shutdown now","tags":"","url":"Cookbook_Linux\/Linux_Command_Line_Interface.html"},{"title":"OpenVINO toolkit installation","text":"OpenVINO\u2122 toolkit The UDOO VISION board is equipped with an Intel\u00ae HD Graphics 500 GPU which is fully supported by the OpenVINO\u2122 toolkit, an open-source framework for optimizing and deploy AI inference.

The main Intel\u2122 Atom\u00ae processor and the ATmega32u4 microcontroller are connected through an internal USB serial connection, so it\u2019s exactly like having an Arduino\u00ae Leonardo connected with a standard PC but all in a small form factor Single Board Computer. The ATmega32u4 microcontroller is a low-power Microchip 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller featuring 32KB self-programming flash program memory, 2.5KB SRAM, 1KB EEPROM, USB 2.0 full-speed\/low speed device, 12-channel 10-bit A\/D-converter, and JTAG interface for on-chip-debug. The device achieves up to 16 MIPS throughput at 16 MHz. 2.7 - 5.5 Volt operation. More technical information about ATmega32u4, like the datasheet, can be found in the Microchip ATmega32u4 page. From the Arduino Leonardo page: The Arduino Leonardo is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4 (datasheet). It has 20 digital input\/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Leonardo differs from all preceding boards in that the ATmega32u4 has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a secondary processor. This allows the Leonardo to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial \/ COM port. It also has other implications for the behavior of the board; these are detailed on the getting started page.","tags":"","url":"Arduino_Leonardo_compatible(ATmega32U4)\/Overview.html"},{"title":"Getting Started with Arduino Leonardo","text":"To start programming the Arduino\u00ae Leonardo-compatible embedded microcontroller of the UDOO VISION you need the Arduino IDE or the Arduino Web IDE. You can refer to the Getting Started with the Arduino Leonardo page on Arduino\u00ae's website. The getting started Arduino page will guide you through the installation of the IDE, Drivers, first example and everything you need to program the Arduino Leonardo and how to use the pinout. You can also find useful tutorials and a useful &quot;please read...&quot; section with lot of specific information for Arduino Leonardo. USB Devices The USB serial device where you can find the Arduino Leonardo-compatible (ATmega32U4) embedded may vary in accordance with the number of USB devices connected to the board. Usually, you should find the Arduino Leonardo-compatible in the COM3 in Windows 10 and \/dev\/ttyACM0 in Unix\/Linux OS. Linux Installation There are known issues with the Arduino\u00ae IDE on Linux that can lead to malfunctions and difficulties in uploading sketches. These known issues have been solved by Arduino (from version 1.8.6 of the IDE) with a script to launch immediately after installing the IDE on the system. We suggest so to use the scripts contained in the Arduino package to install the software and fix these issues. After downloading the package from the official website, and extracting it, you should then run the following commands in a terminal to install the Arduino IDE on your Linux system: sudo .\/install.sh .\/arduino-linux-setup.sh $USER Known issues Heads up! The arduino-linux-setup.sh above will solve the issues of user permissions and sketch upload described below. If you are working with an old version of the IDE where this script is not present you can try to copy it from a new version or manually fix the issues as described below. User permissions Some Linux distributions need to be configured to gain upload permissions to the user to the Arduino tty port. If you find some complications in uploading the Arduino sketch(firmware) through the Arduino IDE, try to add your Linux user to the dialout group with this command: sudo usermod -a -G tty &lt;yourUserName&gt; sudo usermod -a -G dialout &lt;yourUserName&gt; where &lt;yourUserName&gt; is your Linux user name. You will need to log out and log in again for this change to take effect. Sketch upload ModemManager conflict If you have issues when trying to upload a sketch on the Arduino Leonardo-compatible ATmega32U4 of UDOO VISION you probably have a conflict with the program ModemManager (installed by default on many Linux distros like Ubuntu). Modem Manager tries to open any serial port (ttyACM0 of the Arduino Leonardo included) checking if it's a modem and this usually creates conflicts with the upload mechanism. If you have installed ModemManager on your Linux you can try to disable or uninstall it (https:\/\/askubuntu.com\/questions\/216114\/how-can-i-remove-modem-manager-from-boot) Since you probably don't have a modem on your UDOO VISION you can safely uninstall the package to solve the issue or disable it running the commands: sudo systemctl stop ModemManager.service sudo systemctl disable ModemManager.service After this procedure, you should be able to proceed normally and upload the sketch to your board or use the Serial Monitor. The solution of this issue was found in this thread of the Arduino Forum. How to restore the correct uploading state of sketches If you have not taken into account the possible conflict between ModemManager and sketch upload and you have not followed the instructions listed above, it may happen that the Arduino microcontroller is set in a state where the operating system does not see the serial port. This no longer allows you to load the sketch also using a different operating system. To exit from this state you can try to perform the procedure indicated by the Arduino Leonardo page. Pressing the Arduino physical reset button with the right timing it is possible to load a sketch when the serial port of the bootloader is exposed and restore the correct functioning of the ATmega32U4 microcontroller of Arduino Leonardo. Summarising, you need to hit the Arduino IDE Upload button and press the Arduino physical reset button with the right timing immediately after you see the message &quot;Uploading...&quot; appear in the software's status bar. Enable the verbose option of the Arduino IDE upload process can be very useful to understand when to correctly press the reset button . To do so, go to the menu File -&gt; Preference and check the upload option box in the &quot;Show verbose output during&quot; section. The correct time to press the reset button is when starts to appear PORT {} \/ {} =&gt; {} in the log. The IDE will see that port appear and perform the upload using it. Heads up! This won't work if something interferes with the board's USB communication so please, be sure to have resolved such issues as the conflict with ModemManager above.","tags":"","url":"Arduino_Leonardo_compatible(ATmega32U4)\/Getting_Started_with_Arduino_Leonardo.html"},{"title":"Pinout","text":"The embedded Arduino Leonardo-compatible input\/output (I\/O) pins operates at 5V, with a maximum 40 mA DC current per pin.

They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 kOhms. There are six analog input pins at 10-bit resolution, providing a range of 1024 values between ground and 3.3 V. The number of inputs and resolution can be increased if required, by using an external ADC module. The Leonardo has 12 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A11, and all can also be used as digital i\/o. Pins A0-A5 appear in the same locations as on the Uno; inputs A6-A11 are on digital i\/o pins 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 respectively. Each analog input provides 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default the analog inputs measure from ground to 5 volts, though it\u2019s possible to change the upper end of their range using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function. There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off. Analog output is simulated using pulse width modulation (PWM) on digital pins 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11 and 13. For an explanation of PWM, refer to the following Arduino tutorial The pins 3 (interrupt 0), 2 (interrupt 1), 0 (interrupt 2), 1 (interrupt 3) and 7 (interrupt 4) can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value.
